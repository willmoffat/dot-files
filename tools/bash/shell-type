shell is probably(?) run from an automated process so it cannot
assume if it can request input or that someone will see the output.
E.g Maybe it is best to write output to a log-file.

My tests:

X login:   .profile
XTerm:     .bash_rc
ansi-term: .bash_rc
bash:      .bash_rc
ssh:       .bash_profile -> .bashrc

And .bashrc ->
  .bash_aliases
  .bash_local (My custom stuff)
